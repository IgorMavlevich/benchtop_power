# Support plate
Protective base for the "Benchtop power" ATX breakout board, to protect its terminals from unwanted contact as well as the board itself from bending and stress.
Provides fixing points and maximal support for the board and the terminals.

Also, the code is unnecessary complex, I was sleepy at the time :D

Cover and a bracket to mount the whole thing to the PSU are to come...# benchtop_power

# Unfinished: Cover
Enclosure to prettyfy the board. The code is even clumsier, then that for the base. WIP, untested, etc. Not ready yet is what I want to say. Sleepcoding becomes more and more ususal for me.
